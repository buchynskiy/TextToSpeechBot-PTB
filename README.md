# TextToSpeechBot-PTB
Example of PTB Library usage for creating a Telegram Bot that does text-to-speech translations in a couple of languages - Polish, Ukrainian and English.

This is one of my first projects I did back when I was just learning programming fundamentals. It's been online for some time and available in the Telegram app, but I decided to take it down and upload here.

## Installation
Simply install all the libraries from the requirements.txt file:
```bash
  pip install python-telegram-bot==12.7
  pip install gTTS==2.2.3
  pip install python-dotenv==0.19.2
  pip install langdetect==1.0.9
```
Add a API TOKEN to the .env file:
```bash
  APIKEY ="your_api_key"
```
You can now run the bot :)
